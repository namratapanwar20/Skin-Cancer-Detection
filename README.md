# Skin-Cancer-Detection


**Problem :**                                                               

Cancer cell detection and preparing the model based on the dataset


**Tools used here :**  

Numpy,Anaconda ,Google cloab,Python,(CNN /RNN + LSTM or GAN (Generative Model)


**Dataset :**   

MNIST DATASET of SKIN CANCER DETECTION from kaggle


**Process :** 

Using the MNIST Dataset provided in the problem, construct a model for skin cancer detection. There are numerous photos of skin cancer in the provided collection. We are using the Convolutional Neural Network model to deal with this image dataset. CNN is a form of network that deals with image and video processing. We use the Keras library to implement neural networks. As an activation function in this model, we used the relu function (rectified linear unit function). This function turns negative pixels to zero and positive pixels to one which will make classification and analysis much easier.We ran the model with almost 50 epochs to see if there was a difference in accuracy between the epochs and the loss function.Then plot the graph bar of the fraction of false predictions and true label after determining training accuracy. The accuracy of model is approximately 75%.
